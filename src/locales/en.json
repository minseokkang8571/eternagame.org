The target map will have a green check mark when the puzzle has been stabilized. Next, place <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red> bonds one at a time in the middle of stacks, spacing them apart from each other. Check the target map after placing every <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red>; if it turns red, undo that last bond and try again somewhere else.<newline><newline>When you place multiple <blue>U</blue>-<red>G</red>s in a row, they're stronger if they all go in the same direction, with blues on one side and reds on the other.\n",
  "help:boosting-loops-text": "Loops can be strengthened using boosts. The most common loop boost is placing a <red>G</red> at the lowest numbered base next to a stack. There must be an unbonded <yellow>A</yellow> across the stack. Even though it isn't pictured, the <red>G</red> and <yellow>A</yellow> actually form a weak bond; the loop holds them far enough apart to make this possible.<newline><newline>A loop can usually be boosted multiple times if it has more than one stack coming out of it.\n",
  "help:base-numbers-text": "The numbers next to the RNA count bases from the top of a strand to the bottom (when it is unpainted in natural mode). When RNA folds up, the numbers stay next to the same bases.\n",
  "help:bulges-text": "Bulges are loops that always have exactly two adjacent stacks and one or more unbonded bases.<newline><newline>Bulges cannot be boosted.\n",
  "help:1-1-loops-text": "Loops that have one loose nucleotide on each side are called 1-1 loops. They always have two stacks coming out at opposite sides. You can boost 1-1 loops by placing <red>G</red>s on the two unbonded bases. These <red>G</red>s strengthen the loop because they bond to each other. <red>G</red>s rarely bond; here, the 1-1 loop happens to hold them apart from each other at just the right distance to make this possible.\n",
  "help:energy-text": "RNA folds into the state with the lowest energy. A loop with energy of -1 is more likely to fold than a loop with an energy of 2.<newline><newline>Energy is a powerful tool: it lets you see how your choices help the RNA fold.<newline><newline>Remember, negative numbers are better for an RNA. The colors are a helpful reminder - <green>green</green> numbers are strong, and <red>red</red> numbers are weak.<newline><newline>Energy only appears after you paint bonds.\n",
  "help:switch-puzzles-text": "Switch puzzles fold into two different shapes. Switch RNAs change shape when they capture a molecule. However, the sequence of bases doesn't change. The challenge with these puzzles is to design a sequence of bases that works for both shapes.<newline><newline>Click the toggle above the natural/target mode buttons to switch between the two shapes (this toggle only appears on switch levels). The highlighting base tool is extremely useful when solving switch puzzles.\n",
  "help:highlighting-bases-text": "Highlight specific bases by right-clicking them (command-click on a Mac). This will place a black circle around the base. This black circle stays on that base in natural mode and target mode and for both states of a switch puzzle. It's a useful tool when you're trying to understand which bases are stopping an RNA from folding correctly.\n",
